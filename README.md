# from_tutorial-react-firebase_task-manager
This was just a quick project based on an article on logrocket. I wanted to see how to make a very simple crud app with firebase. 
It would still take a lot of time from me, but the project gave me a general insight into this.

The article:

Thanks Logrocket to the great tutorial!
